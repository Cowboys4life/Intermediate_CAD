2.1 Designing the Deck



Description: Designing the deck was pretty easy to do because there was steps to help me complete the deck. It was it a pretty quick assignment that didnt take me long to complete.

Reflection: Buliding the deck made me learn how to use fillets properly. It also made me learn how to use the mirror tool and when to use it properly thanks to Mr. H. Thoose two things were the only things that I learned to use or got help on.
