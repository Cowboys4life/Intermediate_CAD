2.1 Designing the Deck



Description: Designing the deck was pretty easy to do because there was steps to help me complete the deck. It was it a pretty quick assignment that didnt take me long to complete.

Reflection: Buliding the deck made me learn how to use fillets properly. It also made me learn how to use the mirror tool and when to use it properly thanks to Mr. H. Thoose two things were the only things that I learned to use or got help on.



2.2 Designing the Trucks



Description: There was a lot of sketches being made to this one part. It took some time to do but I did complete it. It was prolly the most challenging assignment I have done in a while.

Reflection: While making the trucks I learned how to make things symmetric duriing an extrude. I also learned that you need to have a dimension for pretty much everything in this part. I learned a little bit more geometry by making this part. This is also my first time sketching on the top plane ever.



2.3 Wheel and Bearings



Description: It was a quck easy assignment that didn't take that long to do. The stepswere pretty easy and simple.

Reflection: I learned how to add multiple fillets into one part. I also learned how to use the revovle tool in this part aswell. Making the wheel and bearing is very easy if you just follow the steps that it ask you to do.
